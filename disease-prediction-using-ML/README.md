# Project Title: Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Introduction
This project aims to implement a robust machine-learning model that can efficiently predict the disease of a human, based on the symptoms that he/she possesses. The motivation was to apply and enhance my skills in data preprocessing, model selection, and model evaluation techniques.

## Technologies
- Python 3.10
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Features
- Implements three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest.
- Includes model evaluation and comparison of accuracy.
- Features a Jupyter Notebook with detailed explanations.
