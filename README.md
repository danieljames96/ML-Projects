# ML Projects for self-study

## Introduction
In order to gain hands-on experience in Machine Learning, I have picked up these projects with datasets available in the public domain and common problem statements.

## List of Projects
- Disease Prediction (SVC, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest)
- Identifying Hand Writing from MNIST Database (PyTorch - Logistic Regression)
- Stock Price Prediction using Tensorflow (Tensorflow (Keras) - LTSM)
- American Sign Language Translation (Tensorflow (Keras))
- Simple RAG Model (Sentence Transformer, PyTorch)
